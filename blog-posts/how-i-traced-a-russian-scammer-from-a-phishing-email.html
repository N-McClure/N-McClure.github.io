<!-- Opening Paragraph: Introduction -->
<h3>Introduction: </h3><br>
<p>
    <strong>CONTENT WARNING:</strong> This article mentions the topic of "Sextortion".
    Due to the sensitive nature of this case I will be omitting the targeted victim's name out of respect for their privacy.<br><br>

    Phishing emails are an incredibly common attack tactic that is used by cybercriminals to trick individuals into divulging sensitive information, clicking on malicious links, or downloading harmful attachments. However, these phishing attempts are constantly evolving and becoming more sophisticated, making it increasingly challenging to identify and avoid them.
    In this article I will share my experience of how I was asked by a peer of mine to poke around at an interesting email thy received for help, around
    ended up tracing a Russian scammer to their real identity. I was weary of writing this article at first,
    but after getting consent from my "MT", I decided to share the experience in hopes that it may help others be more aware of such scams.
</p><br>

<!-- Paragraph One (1): Initial Contact and Asking For Help -->
<h3>Initial Contact and Asking for Help: </h3><br>
<p>
    On July 10th 2025 I was contacted by "MT", who had received an interesting phishing email that they wondered if I would be interested in taking a look at it
    and helping them investigate it further. I happily agreed to take a look at it as it sounded like an interesting challenge and a good opportunity for me to practice my digital forensics skiils.<br>
    The email first caught their attention because the email that they received stated that the sender address was the same as the one that received the email, which immediately raised red flags.
    <br><br><img src="blog-posts/media/mt_1.png"><br>
    Upon opening the email because they thought that their account had been compromised, they saw that the email contained a series of claims that covered compromisation of their machine, the downloading of sensitive media, and threats to release the media to their contacts unless a ransom was paid in Bitcoin.
    This is a classic of an extortion scam built on the claim of there being sensitive media involved, commonly referred to as "Sextortion".
    I reassured "MT" that everything was going to be okay and immediately started furthering my investigation.
</p><br>

<!-- Paragraph Two (2): Asking Questions and Gathering Information -->
<h3>Asking Questions and Gathering Information: </h3><br>
<p>
    Before diving into any technical aspects of the investigation, I started by asking "MT" some questions to gather more context and information about the situation.
    I made sure to ensure them that I was completely free of any judgement and that they could be honest with me about anything.<br><br>
    The questions that I asked included:
    <ul>
        <li>Did the claims in the email have any basis of truth (Judgement Free)?</li>
        <li>Had they visited any suspicious websites or links recently?</li>
        <li>Did they notice any unusual or new logins to their email account?</li>
        <li>Did they have any emails in their sent folder that they did not send?</li>
    </ul><br>
    "MT" assured me that none of the claims in the email had any basis of truth, and that they had not visited any suspicious websites or links recently.
    They also mentioned that they had not noticed any unusual logins to their email account, and that there were no emails in their sent folder that they did not send.
    This information was crucial in helping me eliminate certain possibilities / attack vectors and focus my attention on others.
</p><br>

<!-- Paragraph Three (3): Looking For Breaches and Peeking Under The Hood Of The Email -->
<h3>Looking For Breaches and Peeking Under The Hood Of The Email: </h3><br>
<p>
    The next action that I took was to check to see if "MT"'s email address had been found in any recent data breaches.
    To do this, I utilized the website <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/" target="_blank">haveibeenpwned.com</a> which is an extremely popular resource for checking if an email address has been detected in a data breach.
    After entering "MT"'s email into the site, I was suprised and a little concerned with what I found.
    <br><br><img src="blog-posts/media/mt_5.png"><br>
    It turned out that their email had been found in nineteen (19) different data breaches, some of which were quite recent and some of which dated back all the way to December 2012.
    I immediately shared this information with them. It came as no surprise to them as they told me that this is the email that they have used for "spam and subscriptions" for many years.
    This statment made me feel better as it meant that their primary email acount wasn't the one that we were looking at.<br>
    Next, I decided that it was time to look at the contents of the email itself more closely. I proceeded to walk them through the process of viewing the email source code and sending me screenshots of it.
    <br><br><img src="blog-posts/media/mt_2.png"><br>
    While looking through the source code the first thing I focused my attention on was the "Received" headers because I knew that they often contained valuable information about the path that the email took to reach the recipient.
    <h4>Findings from the "Received" Headers:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Odd looking Microsoft Infrastructure Address: </strong>DU2PEPF00028D06.europrd03.prod.outlook.com</li>
        <li><strong>Web Domain: </strong>willowstonecanyon.org</li>
        <li><strong>IP Address Corresponding to the Web Domain: </strong>46.232.41.252</li>
    </ul><br>

    I took note of these findings and continued to skim through the remainder of the code in hunt for any other suspicious looking or interesting elements.
    <br><br><img src="blog-posts/media/mt_4.png"><br>
    The last interesting element that I found in the source code of the email was in the "received-spf" header which contained a message saying that the SPF check for the email had failed and that the IP address "46.232.41.252" was not an authorized sender.
    This was a significant finding as it indicated that the email was likely sent from a compromised server or a server that was not authorized to send emails on behalf of the domain.
</p><br>

<!-- Paragraph Four (4): Tracing the IP Address & Inital Info On Suspect -->
<h3>Tracing the IP Address & Inital Info On Suspect: </h3><br>
<p>
    With the info from the email source in hand, I booted up my "hacking environment" and got to work.
    The first thing that I did was run nmap against the domain to se if there were any ports open but unfortunately the server was offline.
    I confirmed this by pinging the domain and receiving no response back. Looking back as I am writing this I realize I could have saved myself a step running the ping before the nmap scan...oh well, live and learn.
    Next, I used the "whois" command to see if I could uncover some details about the IP's ownership and Location.<br><br>
    <strong>Command Run: </strong>whois 46.232.41.252<br><br>

    <img src="blog-posts/media/whois_pc1.png"><br>
    
    I first noticed that the IP address was tied to the email <strong>pavel_chachin@keemail.me</strong>, which I made a note of because the domain looked odd to me.
    After a quick Google search I learned that the domain "keemail.me" is a privacy-focused, encrypted email service that is associtated with the legitamate email provider "Tuta Mail" (priorly known as "Tutanota") but has been flagged as malicious as their service is often 
    favored and used by cybercriminals for nefarious purposes. You can read more about Tuta Mail's anonymous email service <a href="https://tuta.com/blog/anonymous-email" target="_blank">here</a>.<br><br>

    <img src="blog-posts/media/whois_pc2.png"><br>

    Under the "remarks" section of the output I noticed that it stated "Pending deregistration by the RIPE NCC"
    which indicated to me that the IP address was in the process of being decommissioned and would soon no longer be in use.
    After a search online I learned that the <a href="https://www.ripe.net/" target="blank">RIPE NCC</a> is the Regional Internet Registry (RIR) for Europe, the Middle East, and parts of Central Asia.
    I made sure to take note of this service in case I come across it in any future investigations.<br>
    From the contents of the "netname" field (RU-DOMTEHNIKI-NET-20110209) I deduced...<br><br>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>"RU" :</strong> This IP address is registered in Russia</li>
        <li><strong>"DOMTEHNIKI" :</strong>It is likely owned by a company named "Dom Tekhniki"</li>
        <li><strong>"20110209" :</strong>The IP was likely assigned to this company on February 9th, 2011</li>
    </ul><br>

    I looked into "Dom Tekhniki" and learned that it is a Russian restaurant tht focuses on smoked meats and barbecue.
    I found it odd that a restaurant would be the owner of an IP address that was being used to send phishing emails, which further reinforced my belief that the email was sent from a compromised server or a network that was spoofed to look like it belonged to this restaurant.<br>
    Under the "remarks" sections regarding maintenance permissions it is clear that "Chachin" has complete control over this network.<br><br>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Who can edit (mnt-by) : </strong>chanchinmnt</li>
        <li><strong>Who can create child objects / subnets (mnt-lower) : </strong>chachinmnt</li>
        <li><strong>Who can create BGP route objects (mnt-routes) : </strong>chachinmnt</li>
    </ul><br><br>
    
    <img src="blog-posts/media/whois_pc3.png"><br>

    This block of the "whois" output provided me with an abundance of information that claimed to have belonged to the 
    restaurant "Dom Tekhniki", but I cross referenced the details (address, phone number...etc) provided in the output with the restaurant's official website and found that they did not match up at all.
    This further reinforced my belief that the email was sent from a network that was spoofed to look like it belonged to this restaurant.<br>
    The last portion of the output provided me with a plethora of information about the owner of the IP address.<br><br>

    <img src="blog-posts/media/whois_pc4.png"><br>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Person : </strong>Pavel Chachin</li>
        <li><strong>Address : </strong>Russian federation, Omsk, street Prigorodnaya, 10-38</li>
        <li><strong>Phone : </strong>+73833999950</li>
    </ul><br>

    At this point I had a name, address, phone number, and email address associated with the IP address from the sender of the phish.
    This was a significant breakthrough in my investigation as it provided me with a great foundation to further my investigation with the implementation of OSINT.
</p><br>

<!-- Paragraph Five (5): Digging Deeper Into The Suspect & Building A Profile -->
<h3>Digging Deeper Into The Suspect & Building A Profile: </h3><br>
<p>
    I started this portion of the investigation by taking the name "Pavel Chachin" and inputting it into my browser and seeing what initial results I was able to find.
    To my surprise I was able to find a Facebook profile, and a "Presi" presentation that belonged to a person with the same name that was from the same region of Russia as the address that I had found in the "whois" output.<br>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Facebook Account : </strong><a href=https://www.facebook.com/pavel.chachin.7/" target="blank">https://www.facebook.com/pavel.chachin.7/</a></li>
        <li><strong>"About Me" Presi Presentation : </strong><a href="https://prezi.com/rolmmyabdhim/11111/" target="_blank">https://prezi.com/rolmmyabdhim/11111/</a></li>
    </ul><br><br>

    <img src="blog-posts/media/pc_facebook.png"><br>

    I took note of the information that the Facebook profile and the conveniently made "About Me" presentation provided me with and proceeded to take the 
    username that he used for his Facebook account ("pavel.chachin.7") and ran it through the tool <a href="https://github.com/sherlock-project/sherlock" target="_blank">sherlock</a> to see if there were any other accounts associated with that username across various social media platforms.<br><br>
    <strong>Command Run: </strong>python3 sherlock pavel.chachin.7 --print-found --disable-update-check
    <br><br>
    <img src="blog-posts/media/pc_sherlock.png"><br>
    From this scan I uncovered a multitude of accounts that were tied to this username across various platforms.
    Some of the links did lead to 404 pages but that is a common occurrence when using "sherlock". It can be hit or miss.
    I took note of the active ones (especially the ones with connections to Russia) and pieced together a profile of "Pavel Chachin" based on the information that I found.
    As the goal of this investigation was to determine if the phishing email was legitimate, if "MT"'s account was compromised, and to identify (if I could) the perpetrator behind the scam, I felt that I had gathered enough information at this point to send my findings to "MT".
</p><br>

<!-- Paragraph Six (6): Sending My Findings To The Victim -->
<h3>Sending My Findings To The Victim: </h3><br>
<p>
    After compiling all of my findings into a comprhensive report that detailed each step of my investigation, the evidence I uncovered, and my conclusions, I sent it to "MT" 
    along with a zip file containing all of my raw notes and screenshots that I had taken during the investigation.
    I shared my theory of how I think the attack operated and reassured them that their email account was safe and had not been compromised.
    I also provided them with some best practices to avoid falling victim to such scams in the future, such as enabling two-factor authentication, being cautious of suspicious emails, and regularly updating passwords.
    They were extremely grateful for my help and thanked me profusely for my assistance.
