<h3>Introduction: </h3><br>
<p>
    CONTENT WARNING: This article mentions the topic of "Sextortion", which is a method used by cybercriminals to abuse the existance of sensitve media to extort and blackmail victims into paying them money.
    Please proceed with caution if you are sensitive to this topic.<br>
    Due to the sensitive nature of this case I will be omitting the targeted victim's name out of respect for their privacy.<br><br>

    Phishing emails are an incredibly common attack tactic that is used by cybercriminals to trick individuals into divulging sensitive information, clicking on malicious links, or downloading harmful attachments. However, these phishing attempts are constantly evolving and becoming more sophisticated, making it increasingly challenging to identify and avoid them.
    In this article I will share my experience of how I was asked by a peer of mine to poke around at an interesting email she received for help, around
    ended up tracing a Russian scammer to their real identity. I was weary of writing this article at first because of the sensitive nature of the topic, 
    but after getting consent from my "client", I decided to share the experience in hopes that it may help others be more aware of such scams.
