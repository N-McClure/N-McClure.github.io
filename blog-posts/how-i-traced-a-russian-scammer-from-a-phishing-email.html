<!-- Opening Paragraph: Introduction -->
<h3>Introduction: </h3><br>
<p>
    <strong>CONTENT WARNING:</strong> This article mentions the topic of "Sextortion".
    Due to the sensitive nature of this case I will be omitting the targeted victim's name out of respect for their privacy.<br><br>

    Phishing emails are an incredibly common attack tactic that is used by cybercriminals to trick individuals into divulging sensitive information, clicking on malicious links, or downloading harmful attachments. However, these phishing attempts are constantly evolving and becoming more sophisticated, making it increasingly challenging to identify and avoid them.
    In this article I will share my experience of how I was asked by a peer of mine to poke around at an interesting email thy received for help, around
    ended up tracing a Russian scammer to their real identity. I was weary of writing this article at first,
    but after getting consent from my "MT", I decided to share the experience in hopes that it may help others be more aware of such scams.

<!-- Paragraph One (1): Initial Contact and Asking For Help -->
<h3>Initial Contact and Asking for Help: </h3><br>
<p>
    On July 10th 2025 I was contacted by "MT", who had received an interesting phishing email that they wondered if I would be interested in taking a look at it
    and helping them investigate it further. I happily agreed to take a look at it as it sounded like an interesting challenge and a good opportunity for me to practice my digital forensics skiils.<br>
    The email first caught their attention because the email that they received stated that the sender address was the same as the one that received the email, which immediately raised red flags.

    Upon opening the email because they thought that their account had been compromised, they saw that the email contained a series of claims that covered compromisation of their machine, the downloading of sensitive media, and threats to release the media to their contacts unless a ransom was paid in Bitcoin.
    This is a classic of an extortion scam built on the claim of there being sensitive media involved, commonly referred to as "Sextortion".
    I reassured "MT" that everything was going to be okay and immediately started furthering my investigation.

<!-- Paragraph Two (2): Asking Questions and Gathering Information -->
<h3>Asking Questions and Gathering Information: </h3><br>
<p>
    Before diving into any technical aspects of the investigation, I started by asking "MT" some questions to gather more context and information about the situation.
    I made sure to ensure them that I was completely free of any judgement and that they could be honest with me about anything.<br><br>
    The questions that I asked included:
    <ul>
        <li>Did the claims in the email have any basis of truth (Judgement Free)?</li>
        <li>Had they visited any suspicious websites or links recently?</li>
        <li>Did they notice any unusual or new logins to your email account?</li>
        <li>Did they have any emails in your sent folder that you did not send?</li>
    </ul><br>
    "MT" assured me that none of the claims in the email had any basis of truth, and that they had not visited any suspicious websites or links recently.
    They also mentioned that they had not noticed any unusual logins to their email account, and that there were no emails in their sent folder that they did not send.
    This information was crucial in helping me eliminate certain possibilities / attack vectors and focus my attention on others.

<!-- Paragraph Three (3): Looking For Breaches and Peeking Under The Hood Of The Email -->
<h3>Looking For Breaches and Peeking Under The Hood Of The Email: </h3><br>
<p>
    The next action that I took was to check to see if "MT"'s email address had been found in any recent data breaches.
    To do this, I utilized the website <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/" target="_blank">haveibeenpwned.com</a> which is an extremely popular resource for checking if an email address has been detected in a data breach.
    After entering "MT"'s email into the site, I was suprised and a little concerned with what I found.
