<!-- Introduction: -->
<br><h1>Introdction:</h1><br>
<p>
    This week at ISSessions, in our last meeting before our annual CTF, I presented a quick overview of a recent vulnerability in a popular 
    WordPress plugin called "Quiz and Survey Master" or "QSM" for short. This vulnerability caught my attention because it is an exploit that 
    even an attacker with the lowest of permissions on a target site can manipulate to cause damage and access sensitive information. 
    You can find the initial news article about this vulnerability on Infosecurity Magazine's website <a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/wordpress-sql-injection-flaw-40000/" target="_blank">here</a>,
    the initial vulnerability report from Patchstack <a href="https://patchstack.com/articles/sql-injection-vulnerability-in-quiz-and-survey-master-qsm-plugin-affecting-40k-sites/" target="_blank">here</a>, and the 
    video of me covering the vulnerability at our ISSessions meeting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQBPRAEZKto&t=1061s" target="_blank">here</a>.
