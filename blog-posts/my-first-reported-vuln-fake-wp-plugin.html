<h3>Introduction: </h3><br>
<p>
    On Friday October 10th of 2025, I took some time to learn and become familiar with the usage of the tool WPScan.
    During this exploration of WPScan I decided to run a command on a the website of a local pizzeria because I knew off the top of my head that this site was infat built with WordPress.<br><br>
    <strong>Command I ran : </strong>wpscan --url [website-domain-to-scan] -e vp --plugins-detection mixed --api-token [api-token-for-my-account] --random-user-agent <br><br>
    The WPScan output returned a list of plugins installed on the site and one of them was flagged as vulnerable. It was at this moment that my curiousity got the best of me and I decided to research the flagged plugin.
</p><br>

<!-- Paragraph 1: Discovery and Inital Research -->
<h3>Discovery and Initial Research: </h3><br>
<p>
    <strong>Vulnerability Detected : </strong> blnmrpb - Web Shell in Fake WordPress Plugin<br><br>
    I then proceeded to search online for any information that I could find about this vulnerability. This led me to an article by Sucuri.net that turned out to be the blog posting that covered the initial finding of the Fake Plugin dating back to January of 2020.
    The article provided a detailed breakdown of the vulnerability and how it can be exploited by malicious actors.<br><br>
    <strong>Link to the Article about Vulnerability : </strong><a href="https://blog.sucuri.net/2020/01/webshell-in-fake-plugin-blnmrpb-directory.html">https://blog.sucuri.net/2020/01/webshell-in-fake-plugin-blnmrpb-directory.html</a><br><br>
    
    <strong>Breakdown of the Fake Plugin Contents:</strong><br>
    <ul>
        <li>The plugin contains two (2) files, index.php and log.txt</li>
        <li>index.php --> Full of comments and one (1) line of PHP code that opens the log.txt file.</li>
        <li>log.txt --> Contains the actual PHP code for the web shell to be executed.</li>
        <li>Plugin Path --> [target-domain]/wp-content/plugins/blnmrpb</li>
    </ul><br>
    <img src="blog-posts/media/marianos_403.png"><br>
    I then went to the path that the plugin is supposed to be located at on the website and was hit with an Error 403 Forbidden, which confirmed that the path did indeed exist on the site but was not accessible from a client-side perspective.<br><br>
    Once I had a better understanding of how this "plugin" worked and what it was capable of allowing an attacker to do, I worked on compiling all of my notes, scan outputs, and other documentation into a more formal report.
</p><br>

<!-- Paragraph 2: Documentation and Reporting -->
<h3>Documentation and Reporting: </h3><br>
<p>
    Compiling all of my notes and findings into a report that I could present to the owners of the pizzeria was a daunting task not only because this was my first time doing this kind of thing, but because I used to work at the company and the last thing I wanted was for them to think that I was trying to cause trouble as revenge for terminating my employment.
    When I was undergoing the process of taking my super technical notes and forming a report that was not overflowing with technical jargon while still being clear and concise enough to explain the functionaily and risks of the vulnerability, I found great help from my buddy <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jondmarien/">Jon Marien</a> as well as two (2) videos by NahamSec covering <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR_OQsRFd7g">writing Pentest Reports</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR_OQsRFd7g">writing good Proof of Concept Reports.</a>
    Almost a week later, as I was sitting in one of my classes and after some discussion with my classmates regarding "The Hacker Code of Ethics", I sent the owners a text telling them that I found a vulnerability on their site and would love to share my report with them regarding my findings and steps to patch it.
    I held my breath for almost an hour while I watched the status of the message go from "Sent" to "Delivered" to eventually "Read".
</p><br>

<!-- Paragraph 3: Response and Over-The-Phone Follow-Up -->
<h3>Response and Over-the-Phone Follow-Up: </h3><br>
<p>
    When I received the initial response from one of the co-owners of the pizzeria, I was both relieved and excited to see that they were appreciative of me bringing this to their attention.
    He was very interested in learning more about what I had found and shared his e-mail with me so I could send over the .zip file containing all of my documentation and final report.
    Upon sending over the report I spent the next handful of hours engaging in a text exchange with both of the owners and walked them through the remediation steps that I had outlined in my report to patch the vulnerability. It was a little tedious to try and solve this issue without having my boots on the ground but I treated this as the opportunity it was to practice my communication and "customer service" skills.
    We eventually were able to remove the fake plugin from the site and did some credential rotation for all the admin accounts just as an extra security measure.
    I went over a few days ago to check in on everything and they expressed their gratitude again and we discussed making this a yearly service that I do for them as a part of them maintaining the health of their site. I happily said yes.
