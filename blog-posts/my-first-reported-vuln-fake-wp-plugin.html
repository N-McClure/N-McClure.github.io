<h3>Introduction: </h3><br>
<p>
    On Friday October 10th of 2025, I took some time to learn and become familiar with the usage of the tool WPScan.
    During this exploration of WPScan I decided to run a command on a the website of a local pizzeria because I knew off the top of my head that this site was infat built with WordPress.<br><br>
    <strong>Command I ran : </strong>wpscan --url [website-domain-to-scan] -e vp --plugins-detection mixed --api-token [api-token-for-my-account] --random-user-agent <br><br>
    The WPScan output returned a list of plugins installed on the site and one of them was flagged as vulnerable. It was at this moment that my curiousity got the best of me and I decided to research the flagged plugin.
</p><br>

<!-- Paragraph 1: Discovery and Inital Research -->
<h3>Discovery and Initial Research: </h3><br>
<p>
    <strong>Vulnerability Detected : </strong> blnmrpb - Web Shell in Fake WordPress Plugin<br><br>
    I then proceeded to search online for any information that I could find about this vulnerability. This led me to an article by Sucuri.net that turned out to be the blog posting that covered the initial finding of the Fake Plugin dating back to January of 2020.
    The article provided a detailed breakdown of the vulnerability and how it can be exploited by malicious actors.<br><br>
    <strong>Link to the Article about Vulnerability : </strong><a href="https://blog.sucuri.net/2020/01/webshell-in-fake-plugin-blnmrpb-directory.html">https://blog.sucuri.net/2020/01/webshell-in-fake-plugin-blnmrpb-directory.html</a><br><br>
    
    <strong>Breakdown of the Fake Plugin Contents:</strong><br>
    <ul>
        <li>The plugin contains two (2) files, index.php and log.txt</li>
        <li>index.php --> Full of comments and one (1) line of PHP code that opens the log.txt file.</li>
        <li>log.txt --> Contains the actual PHP code for the web shell to be executed.</li>
        <li>Plugin Path --> [target-domain]/wp-content/plugins/blnmrpb</li>
    </ul><br>
    <img src="blog-posts/media/marianos_403.png"><br>
    I then went to the path that the plugin is supposed to be located at on the website and was hit with an Error 403 Forbidden, which confirmed that the path did indeed exist on the site but was not accessible from a client-side perspective.<br><br>
    Once I had a better understanding of how this "plugin" worked and what it was capable of allowing an attacker to do, I worked on compiling all of my notes, scan outputs, and other documentation into a more formal report.
</p><br>

<!-- Paragraph 2: Documentation and Reporting -->
<h3>Documentation and Reporting: </h3><br>
<p>
    Compiling all of my notes and findings into a report that I could present to the owners of the pizzeria was a daunting task not only because this was my first time doing this kind of thing, but because I used to work at the company and the last thing I wanted was for them to think that I was trying to cause trouble as revenge for terminating my employment.
    When I was undergoing the process of taking my super technical notes and forming a report that was not overflowing with technical jargon while still being clear and concise enough to explain the functionaily and risks of the vulnerability, I found great help from my buddy <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jondmarien/">Jon Marien</a> as well as two (2) videos by NahamSec covering <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR_OQsRFd7g">writing Pentest Reports</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR_OQsRFd7g">writing good Proof of Concept Reports.</a>
