<h3>Introduction:</h3><br>
<p>
    This week at ISS, I shared an interesting article that I came across and shared during the "News Segment" section of the session.
    The <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2025/11/sneaky-2fa-phishing-kit-adds-bitb-pop.html">article</a> talks about a new kit that is being used in phishing campaigns to utilize a technique called "Browser-in-the-Browser" (BitB) attacks.
    You can watch the full session <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2OxKKM7R6U&t=3964s" target="_blank">here</a> on YouTube.
