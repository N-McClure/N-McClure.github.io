<br><h3>Introduction</h3><br>
<p>
    This week at ISS (hosted virtually due to campus closure becuase of a terrible snow storm) I shared an article
    during the "News Segment" portion of our meeting, about a Multi-Stage phishing campaign that has been targeting Russians with
    Remote-Access-Trojans (RATs) and Ransomware. You can find the original posting from Fortinet <a href="https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/inside-a-multi-stage-windows-malware-campaign" target="blank">here</a>, 
    the news article I initially read from "The Hacker News" <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2026/01/multi-stage-phishing-campaign-targets.html" target="blank">here</a>,
    and the video stream of the session <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpCXd2waJA" target="blank">here</a>.

<h3>Summary of the Article and Key Points:</h3><br>
<p>
    Researchers at Fortinet have reported that a sophisticated multi-stage phishing campaign that has been taergeting individuals in 
    Russia. The campaign employs spear-phishing emails to deliver malicious .zip files, which contain a PowerShell 
    loader script that doenloads additional payloads from GitHub. The attackers utilize various techniques to evade
    detection, including the disabling of security protections on the victim's machine and deploying multiple payloads,
    such as the <strong>Amnesia RAT</strong> and a version of the <strong>Hakuna Matata Ransomware</strong>.
    The article goes on to detail the attack chain, from initial infection to payload deployment, and highlights the
    dangers posed by such multi-stage attacks.<br><br>

    <h4>Attack Chain / Flow:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Victim Receives Phishing email containing malicious .zip file.</li>
        <li>Victim extracts .zip file and runs PowerShell loader script.</li>
        <li>PowerShell script downloads additional payloads from GitHub.</li>
        <li>Script disables security protections on the victim's machine.</li>
        <li>First payload deployed: Amnesia RAT for reconnaissance and persistence.</li>
        <li>Second payload deployed: Hakuna Matata Ransomware to encrypt files.</li>
    </ol>

<!-- Technical Breakdown of the Attack: -->
<h3>Technical Breakdown of the Attack:</h3><br>
<p>
    <!-- 1. Victim Receives Phishing email and Malicious .zip: -->
    <h4>1. Victim Receives Phishing email containing malicious .zip file:</h4>
    This attack begins with a spear-phishing email that is sent to the victim. The email contains a .zip file attachment that is designed to
    look legitimate and entice the victim to download / open it's contents. Amongst the various decoy files within the archive
    there is a malicious shortcut file (.lnk) that has filenames in the Russian language.
    The shortcut file utilizes the usage of double file extensions (e.g. "Задание_для_бухгалтера_02отдела.txt.lnk") to fool the victim that it is simply a text file that is no different than any of the others
    in the archive.<br><br>

    <!-- 2. Victim extracts .zip file and runs PowerShell loader script: -->
    <h4>2. Victim Extracts .zip File & Runs PowerShell Loader Script:</h4>
    When the victim clicks the malicious shortcut file, it executes a PowerShell command that downloads another PowerShell
    script from a GitHub repository that is utilized in the next stage of the attack.
    The use of GitHub as a hosting platform for the attacker's payloads is a common tactic used by threat actors to evade detection, as it allows them to leverage a trusted platform to distribute their malicious code.<br><br>
