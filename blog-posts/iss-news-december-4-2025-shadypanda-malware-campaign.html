<h3>Introduction:</h3><br>
<p>
    This week for the "News Segment" portion at ISS, I presented a summary and breakdown of a fascinating article that I read that talked about a malware campaign that lasted 7 years, impacted 4.3 Million victims, and utilized Browser Extensions to go undetected until it was too late.
    This particular story caught my attention because as someone who is building a project that involves Browser Extensions, I had the understanding that 
    code is reviewed before being published to the Extension Stores, so I was curious to learn how exactly the malicious actor was able to push so much harmful code to so many users without being detected for such a long period of time.
    You can find the original article I read on "The Register" <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/12/01/chrome_edge_malicious_browser_extensions/" target="blank">here</a>, another article that covers the same story but provides a list of some of the Malicious Extension IDs <a href="https://www.koi.ai/blog/4-million-browsers-infected-inside-shadypanda-7-year-malware-campaign#heading-7" target="blank">here</a>,
    and the ISSessions video where I covered this article <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJQu_0HFz-Y" target="blank">here</a>.
