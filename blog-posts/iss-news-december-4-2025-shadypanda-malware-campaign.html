<h3>Introduction:</h3><br>
<p>
    This week for the "News Segment" portion at ISS, I presented a summary and breakdown of a fascinating article that I read that talked about a malware campaign that lasted 7 years, impacted 4.3 Million victims, and utilized Browser Extensions to go undetected until it was too late.
    This particular story caught my attention because as someone who is building a project that involves Browser Extensions, I had the understanding that 
    code is reviewed before being published to the Extension Stores, so I was curious to learn how exactly the malicious actor was able to push so much harmful code to so many users without being detected for such a long period of time.
    You can find the original article I read on "The Register" <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/12/01/chrome_edge_malicious_browser_extensions/" target="blank">here</a>, another article that covers the same story but provides a list of some of the Malicious Extension IDs <a href="https://www.koi.ai/blog/4-million-browsers-infected-inside-shadypanda-7-year-malware-campaign#heading-7" target="blank">here</a>,
    and the ISSessions video where I covered this article <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJQu_0HFz-Y" target="blank">here</a>.

<!-- Summary of the Article: -->
<h3>Summary and Key Points:</h3><br>
<p>
    A threat actor known by the moniker "ShadyPanda" ran a multi-year campaign (dating back to 2018), where they published "normal" browser extensions
    for popular browsers like Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge that had good reviews, "Featured" / "Verified" statuses, and an incredibly high amount of installs that sat in the millions.
    Nothing about these extensions seemed off or out of the ordinary..that all changed at some point in mid-late 2024.
    At that time, the threat actor pushed various updates to these extensions and transformed these once "normal" extensions into a variety of malicious pieces of software that had a wide range of harmful capabilities and were completely unbeknownst to the victims.<br>
    The malicious abilities included;
    <ul>
        <li>Remote Code Execution (RCE) inside the browser.</li>
        <li>Full Browser Surveillance and Spyware.</li>
        <li>Injection of Malicious Content / Modification of Web Pages.</li>
        <li>Anti-Analysis Abilities.</li>
        <li>Real-Time User Interaction Monitoring.</li>
    </ul><br><br>

    In total, it is estimated that over 4.3 Million users were infected by this "Supply-Chain" attack campaign across multiple different browser platforms.
    Although Google and Microsoft have done a good job of removing these malicious extensions from their stores, at the time of writing this it is said that a handful of the extensions
    are still live on the Microsoft Edge store.
    This campaign abused the trust model of browser extension markets and demonstrated how dangerous they can be by remaining dormant for years before quietly being weaponized against their users...like "sleeper agents" waiting to take down an enemy.

<h3>Breakdown of the Various Malicious Functions and Capabilities:</h3><br>
<p>
    <!-- Remote Code Execution (RCE) Inside the Browser: -->
    <h4>Remote Code Execution (RCE) Inside the Browser:</h4>
    Once the extensions were updated and deployed, they were able to download arbitrary Javascript (JS) code from a Command-And-Control (C2) server that is controlled by 
    the malicious actor (ShadyPanda) on an hourly basis, and execute it with full browser API access and privileges.
    This allowed the threat actor to run any code they wanted inside the victim's browser, giving them a wide range of options for further exploitation.<br><br>

    <!-- Full Browser Surveillance and Spyware: -->
    <h4>Full Browser Surveillance and Spyware:</h4>
    These extenstions were capable of collecting and exfiltrating a broad range of sensitive user data from victims including:
    <ul>
        <li>Every URL visited</li>
        <li>HTTP Referrers</li>
        <li>Timestamps (for activity profiling)</li>
        <li>Persistent Unique IDs per user for tracking</li>
        <li>Full Browser Fingerprinting</li>
    </ul><br>
    This data was sent back to the C2 server for analysis and potential further exploitation by the threat actor.<br><br>

    <!-- Injection of Malicious Content / Modification of Webpages: -->
    <h4>Injection of Malicious Content / Modification of Web Pages:</h4>
    Due to how the malicious extenstions had full access to the browser APIs, they were able to modify the content of web pages that the victims visited in real-time.
    This included injecting malicious ads, phishing forms, or other harmful content into legitimate websites, putting users at risk of further attacks.<br><br>
